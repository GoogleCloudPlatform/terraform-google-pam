# Cloud Privileged Access Manager (PAM) Module
This module makes it easy to set up [Privileged Access Manager](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/pam-overview). Privileged Access Manager (PAM) is a Google Cloud native, managed solution to secure, manage and audit privileged access while ensuring operational velocity and developer productivity. PAM enables just-in-time, time-bound, approval-based access elevations, and auditing of privileged access elevations and activity. PAM lets you define the rules of who can access, what they can access, and if they should be granted access with or without approvals based on the sensitivity of the access and emergency of the situation.

Functional examples are included in the [examples](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-google-pam/tree/main/examples) directory

##  Usage

```tf
# Configure Cloud Privilege Access Management (PAM)
module "entitlement_project" {
  source  = "GoogleCloudPlatform/pam/google"
  version = "~> 2.1"

  entitlement_id                  = "example-entitlement-project"
  parent_id                       = var.project_id
  parent_type                     = "project"
  grant_service_agent_permissions = true

  organization_id = var.org_id

  entitlement_requesters = [
    "serviceAccount:${var.entitlement_requester}",
  ]
  entitlement_approvers = [
    "domain:google.com",
  ]
  role_bindings = [
    {
      role                 = "roles/storage.admin"
      condition_expression = "request.time < timestamp(\"2024-04-23T18:30:00.000Z\")"
    },
    {
      role = "roles/bigquery.admin"
    }
  ]
}
```

| entitlement\_availability\_notification\_recipients | List of email addresses to be notified when a entitlement is created. These email addresses will receive an email about availability of the entitlement | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| entitlement\_id | The ID to use for this Entitlement. This will become the last part of the resource name. This value should be 4-63 characters. This value should be unique among all other Entitlements under the specified parent | `string` | n/a | yes |
| entitlement\_requesters | Required List of users, groups, service accounts or domains who can request grants using this entitlement. Can be one or more of Google Account email, Google Group, Service account or Google Workspace domain | `list(string)` | n/a | yes |
| grant\_service\_agent\_permissions | Whether or not to grant roles/privilegedaccessmanager.serviceAgent role to PAM service account | `bool` | `false` | no |
| location | The region of the Entitlement resource | `string` | `"global"` | no |
| max\_request\_duration\_hours | The maximum amount of time for which access would be granted for a request. A requester can choose to ask for access for less than this duration but never more | `number` | `1` | no |
| organization\_id | Organization id | `string` | n/a | yes |
| parent\_id | The ID of organization, folder, or project to create the entitlement in | `string` | n/a | yes |

| require\_approver\_justification | Do the approvers need to provide a justification for their actions | `bool` | `true` | no |
| role\_bindings | The maximum amount of time for which access would be granted for a request. A requester can choose to ask for access for less than this duration but never more | <pre>list(object({<br>    role                 = string<br>    condition_expression = optional(string)<br>  }))</pre> | n/a | yes |
